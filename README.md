# Smart-parking-system
Task 1
Given by Bharat Intern
This code provides a basic framework for an IoT-based smart parking management system. You can expand on it by adding more parking spaces, integrating a display or mobile app for real-time information, or incorporating other features as per your requirements.
In this code, the ultrasonic sensor is connected to pin 2 of the Arduino board. You need to adjust the threshold value in the "isCarPresent" check according to your specific setup.The updateParkingSpaceStatus function sends an HTTP POST request to the web server with the parking space status data. Make sure to change the endpoint variable to match the URL of your server-side script that handles the parking space status update. Remember to replace the placeholders, such as the MAC address, server URL, and parking space identifier, with your actual values.
Working:
     The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a car in a parking space. The ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object, which in this case would be a car. Based on the measured time, the system calculates the distance between the sensor and the car. If the measured distance is below a certain threshold, it indicates that a car is present in the parking space. If the distance is above the threshold, it means the parking space is empty. The Arduino board reads the sensor data and communicates with a web server using Ethernet connectivity. The Arduino sends an HTTP POST request to the web server, informing it about the parking space status (occupied or empty) based on the sensor readings. The web server receives the data and updates the parking space status on the server-side database or system. This information can be accessed by users through a website, mobile app, or any other interface connected to the web server, allowing them to check the availability of parking spaces in real-time. The process continues in a loop, continuously monitoring the parking spaces and updating the server with the latest information.
